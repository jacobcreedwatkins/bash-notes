Write a script which finds and hashes the contents 3 levels deep from each of these directories:	/bin	/etc	/var




Have your script exclude named pipes.  These can break your script.


Have your script redirect STDOUT and STDERR to a separate files.


Your script should determine the count of files hashed in the file with hashes.


Determine the count of unsuccessfully-hashed directories.


Have both counts output to the screen with an appropriate title for each count.

#!/bin/bash


#Variable for directories

DIRS='/bin /etc /var'

#find foo

find $DIRS -maxdepth 3 ! -type p -exec md5sum {} \; 2> /home/student/scripts/activity_15/errors.del > /home/student/scripts/activity_15/good.del
# 'max depth 3' Only search 3 directories deep
#  '! -type p' Don't look for named pipes
#  '-exec md5sum {} \;' md5sum of everything returned from find comand

echo "Successfully Hashed Files: $(cat /home/student/scripts/activity_15/good.del | wc -l)"

echo "Unsuccessfully Hashed Directories: $(cat /home/student/scripts/activity_15/errors.del | wc -l)"
